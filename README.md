# Explanation of the program :

This student grade calculator program in Java manages student records and calculates their grades based on input scores. 

Student Class Represents a student with attributes such as name, ID, and scores. It includes methods to set and get these attributes, as well as compute the average score and determine the grade based on predefined grading criteria.

GradeCalculator Class Manages the calculation of grades for each student. It computes the average score from a list of scores, determines the corresponding grade (e.g., A, B, C, etc.) based on grading thresholds, and may include methods to format and display the grade.

Main Class Serves as the entry point of the program, providing a user interface through the command line . It allows users to input student details and scores, invokes methods from Student and GradeCalculator classes to compute grades, and displays results such as student information and final grades.
